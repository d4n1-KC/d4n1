# Reports

This directory contains a collection of cybersecurity reports written as part of training exercises and professional simulations.  
Each report documents the analysis of vulnerabilities, threat behaviors, and defensive recommendations.

All case studies and datasets reference **Elysium**, a **fictional company** created for educational purposes.  
Names, IP addresses, and environments are **entirely fictitious**.

The goal of these reports is to demonstrate:
- Analytical methodology and structured reporting.
- Risk assessment and mitigation proposals.
- Incident response documentation practices.
