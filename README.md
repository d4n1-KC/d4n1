### Cybersecurity | Blue Team | Threat Detection | Incident Response

I’m not just focused on detecting attacks — I’m focused on understanding them.  
Every log, every trace, every byte tells a story. My role is to interpret that story to strengthen digital defense.

### Profile
I am a cybersecurity professional in training, focused on **defensive security, detection engineering, incident response, and digital forensics**.  
My goal is to understand adversary behavior in order to build smarter defensive strategies. For that reason, I complement my Blue Team work with **ethical pentesting and controlled red team exercises**.

I work across self-hosted labs, virtualized environments, and digital platforms — analyzing network traffic, correlating events, and automating defensive tasks using Python and Bash.  
My approach is based on continuous improvement, technical documentation, and hands-on practice.

### Areas of Focus
**Blue Team:** detection, correlation, threat hunting, and system hardening.  
**Digital Forensics:** memory analysis, log investigation, and artifact examination.  
**OSINT & Threat Intelligence:** open-source data collection and contextual analysis.  
**Ethical Pentesting (complementary):** understanding attack vectors to reinforce defensive posture.  
**Automation:** Python scripting for defensive operations and configuration validation.

### Recent Projects
**BlueLab — Event Analysis in Windows Environments**  
> Laboratory focused on malware behavior and detection using Sysmon and Splunk.  

**DVWA Report — Web Vulnerability Analysis**  
> Ethical pentesting exercise in a controlled Docker environment. Includes risk assessment and mitigation recommendations.  

**DNS Tunneling Lab — Network Evasion and Detection Study**  
> Three-machine setup designed to simulate and detect DNS tunneling using Suricata and Bind9. Focused on alert tuning, traffic inspection, and detection rule refinement.  

**OSINT Toolkit — Python Scripts for Digital Investigation**  
> A collection of lightweight tools for data gathering, scraping, and enrichment from open sources.

### Frequently Used Tools
Wireshark · Splunk · Zeek · Suricata · Autopsy · Python · Bash · Git · Docker · Caido · Elastic Stack · Linux · Windows

### Work Philosophy
I don’t believe in improvisation or in technological paranoia.  
I believe in **methodical observation**, **data correlation**, **analytical discipline**, and the **ability to anticipate the adversary**.

For me, cybersecurity is not just a set of tools —  
it’s a way of thinking.
