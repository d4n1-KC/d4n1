# Home Labs

This folder contains hands-on cybersecurity labs developed in controlled environments.  
Each lab is designed to replicate real-world attack and defense scenarios, focusing on **Blue Team analysis, detection, and response**.

Environments include custom-built VMs and isolated networks simulating systems from the fictional company **Elysium**.  
All configurations, data, and logs are **entirely fictional** and used strictly for research and skill development.

The labs cover areas such as:
- Network monitoring and threat detection.
- Log analysis and event correlation.
- Forensic investigation and alert tuning.
- Automation and security validation.

> Built for continuous learning and defensive mindset development.
